# PlusClouds VM Agent

> **The foundation that thinks.**

The PlusClouds VM Agent is a lightweight, production-grade daemon that turns any Linux or Windows machine into an intelligent infrastructure node. It connects to the PlusClouds platform over NATS, streams real-time telemetry, executes remote commands, and announces its own capabilities — so your platform always knows exactly what each machine can do.

No REST API. No open ports. No certificates to manage. Just a single binary, a config file, and a secure WebSocket connection to the platform.

---

## What it does

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Real-time telemetry** | CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network metrics pushed every 30 seconds |
| **Remote command execution** | Service management, system updates, and custom operations triggered from the platform |
| **Capability discovery** | On boot the agent publishes its full operation schema — the platform always knows what it can do |
| **Heartbeat** | Keeps the `is_alive` status current on the platform every 30 seconds |
| **Cross-platform** | Single codebase, two binaries: Linux (systemd/D-Bus) and Windows (SCM stub) |
| **Zero open ports** | Outbound-only NATS WebSocket connection — no inbound firewall rules needed |

---

## Architecture

The agent communicates exclusively over NATS. It subscribes to its own command subject and publishes events to its own event subject.

```
agent.vm.{uuid}.cmd   ←  platform sends commands
agent.vm.{uuid}.evt   →  agent sends telemetry, heartbeat, capabilities, results
vm.{uuid}.telemetry   →  client-facing telemetry stream (VM_TELEMETRY JetStream, 15-min retention)
```

Authentication uses the `agent_api_key` from `agent.yaml` (written by the platform during provisioning). The NATS auth callout validates every connection against the platform database and issues a scoped JWT — no static passwords, no shared secrets.

### Message envelope

Every NATS message in either direction shares a common JSON envelope:

```json
{
  "v":          1,
  "id":         "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "type":       "command|telemetry|heartbeat|capabilities|result|...",
  "agent_type": "vm",
  "agent_uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "timestamp":  1748000000,
  "payload":    {}
}
```

See [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md) for the full payload schema for every event type.

## Telemetry payload

The agent publishes a structured telemetry snapshot every 30 seconds:

```json
{
  "cpu": {
    "usage_pct":  12.5,
    "core_count": 4,
    "load_avg":   [0.18, 0.23, 0.09],
    "cores": [
      { "id": 0, "usage_pct": 15.2 },
      { "id": 1, "usage_pct": 9.8 }
    ]
  },
  "memory": {
    "total_bytes": 4051935232,
    "used_bytes":  564654080,
    "usage_pct":   13.9
  },
  "disks": [
    {
      "device": "/dev/xvda2", "mountpoint": "/",
      "total_bytes": 42156257280, "used_bytes": 7149359104, "usage_pct": 17.7,
      "io": {
        "read_bytes_per_s": 1048576, "write_bytes_per_s": 524288,
        "read_iops": 120, "write_iops": 45, "util_pct": 23.4
      }
    }
  ],
  "network": [
    { "interface": "eth0", "bytes_sent": 95310, "bytes_recv": 1652348, "is_up": true }
  ]
}
```

Disk I/O rates are calculated as a delta between consecutive snapshots — the first telemetry event after boot omits the `io` field. Pseudo-filesystems (`tmpfs`, `devtmpfs`, etc.) and virtual network interfaces (`lo`, `docker*`, `veth*`) are automatically excluded.

---

## Supported operations

The agent announces its available operations on boot via a `capabilities` event. The platform can also request a fresh capabilities list at any time by sending `agent.allowed_operations`.

| Operation | Description | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `agent.allowed_operations` | Re-publish the capabilities list | — |
| `services.list` | List all loaded systemd services | — |
| `services.get` | Get status of a single service | `name` (string) |
| `services.start` | Start a service | `name` (string) |
| `services.stop` | Stop a service | `name` (string) |
| `services.restart` | Restart a service | `name` (string) |
| `services.reload` | Reload a service | `name` (string) |
| `services.enable` | Enable a service on boot | `name` (string) |
| `services.disable` | Disable a service on boot | `name` (string) |
| `system.info` | Hostname, OS, kernel, uptime | — |
| `system.metrics` | Full resource snapshot | — |
| `system.cpu` | CPU usage + per-core breakdown | — |
| `system.memory` | RAM utilisation | — |
| `system.disk` | Disk usage + I/O rates | — |
| `system.network` | Network interface counters | — |
| `system.update` | `apt-get update && upgrade -y` | — (Ubuntu/Debian only) |
| `telemetry.set_interval` | Change telemetry push interval | `interval_s` (integer, min 5) |
| `vm.reboot` | Reboot the machine | — |
| `vm.shutdown` | Shut down the machine | — |
| `exec` | Run an allowed binary | `command` (string), `args` (array) |

All operations are opt-in. Remove any entry from `allowed_operations` in `agent.yaml` and the platform receives a `rejected` result instead of executing it.

## Installation

### 1. Deploy the binary

```bash
# Linux
scp bin/plusclouds.linux root@<server-ip>:/usr/local/bin/plusclouds-agent
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/plusclouds-agent

# Windows
# Copy bin/plusclouds.windows to the target machine and run it as a service
```

### 2. Create the config directory

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/plusclouds /var/log/plusclouds
chmod 0750 /var/log/plusclouds
```

### 3. Deploy the config

```bash
scp configs/agent.yaml root@<server-ip>:/etc/plusclouds/agent.yaml
```

Edit `/etc/plusclouds/agent.yaml` and set the identity fields for this machine (written automatically during VM provisioning):

```yaml
nats:
  connection_type: websocket           # "nats" or "websocket"
  websocket_url: wss://nats.plusclouds.com:443
  agent_uuid: "<vm-uuid>"             # from iaas_virtual_machines
  api_key:     "<agent-api-key>"      # from iaas_virtual_machines.events_token
```

### 4. Install and start the systemd service

```bash
scp systemd/plusclouds-agent.service root@<server-ip>:/etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now plusclouds-agent
```

### 5. Verify

```bash
journalctl -fu plusclouds-agent
# or
tail -f /var/log/plusclouds/agent.log | jq .
```

You should see:
```
agent identity resolved   {"agent_uuid": "..."}
connected to NATS         {"url": "wss://nats.plusclouds.com:443"}
capabilities published    {"operation_count": 17}
heartbeat published
telemetry published
```

## Platform compatibility

| Feature | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| NATS connection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Telemetry (CPU, RAM, disk, network) | ✅ | ✅ (load_avg = 0) |
| Heartbeat | ✅ | ✅ |
| Capabilities event | ✅ | ✅ |
| Service management | ✅ systemd/D-Bus | ⚙ stub (SCM planned) |
| `system.update` | ✅ Ubuntu/Debian | ✗ |
| `vm.reboot` / `vm.shutdown` | ✅ `systemctl` | ✅ `shutdown /r` |

## Security model

- **Outbound-only** — the agent never listens on any port
- **Scoped JWT** — the NATS auth callout issues a JWT granting publish/subscribe only to this agent's own subjects
- **Operation allowlist** — `allowed_operations` in `agent.yaml` is a hard gate; unknown or unlisted operations return `rejected`
- **Exec allowlist** — when `exec` is enabled, only binaries explicitly listed in `allowed_commands` can be invoked
- **Token revocation** — remove `events_token` from the platform database and the agent is rejected on its next connection attempt
